# ATM Interface

This project is a fully interactive ATM simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface allows users to log in using a customer number and PIN, and access features such as viewing balances, withdrawing money, depositing funds, and transferring between accounts. It mimics the functionality of a real ATM system with a clean and user-friendly design.

## Features

- **Login System**: Customers can log in with a customer number and PIN.
- **Checkings and Savings Accounts**: Options to manage both checkings and savings accounts.
- **View Balance**: Displays the current balance for the selected account.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Allows the user to withdraw funds from their account, with validation for insufficient funds.
- **Deposit Funds**: Provides functionality to deposit funds into the account.
- **Transfer Funds**: Transfers funds between the checkings and savings accounts.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile screens.
