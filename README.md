ATM Interface
This project is a fully interactive ATM simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface allows users to log in using a customer number and PIN, and access features such as viewing balances, withdrawing money, depositing funds, and transferring between accounts. It mimics the functionality of a real ATM system with a clean and user-friendly design.
